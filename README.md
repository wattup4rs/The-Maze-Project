# The Maze

The Maze is 3D game built using SDL and Raycasting. On the map, the player can move in all four directions using keys ```W```, ```A```, ```S```, and ```D```. 

The player can move through the maze and turn left or right as desired.

If the player hits a wall, they cannot move unless they change their direction.

The player can move on several directions and rotate in the same time.
